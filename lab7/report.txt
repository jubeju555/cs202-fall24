In your own words, what is the benefit of a recursive solution to
enumerate all of the nqueens potential solutions (2 points)

By going through all possible solutions, the brute force method ensures that no valid 
solutions are missed. When dealing with increasingly complex problems, the number of 
possible solutions can grow, and the patterns in which they appear may become unclear. 
However, by thoroughly considering every solution, even though it may take more time, 
you can ensure higher accuracy.

- Also in your own words, what are the theoretical and/or practical
advantages of constraining the search space to only still valid 
solutions?

A recursive solution reduces the number of calculations the computer needs to perform by 
eliminating sets of solutions that are invalid based on predefined constraints. 
By pruning these invalid options early, the computer can focus only on valid possibilities, 
significantly reducing the time it takes to find all possible solutions.
