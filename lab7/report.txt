 In your own words, what is the benefit of a recursive solution to
enumerate all of the nqueens potential solutions (2 points)

by goign through all possible solutions you ensure that no solutions that may have been missed are skipped. 
when it comes to more and more complex problems the amount of solutions becomes unclear as well as the pattern
that they appear. so ensuring that every solution is thought through even though it may take a little more time, 
willensure that the accuaracy is higher. 

- Also in your own words, what are the theoretical and/or practical
advantages of constraining the search space to only still valid 
solutions?

a recursive solution cuts down on the number of solutions/ calculations that the computer has
to calculate, by getting rid of a set of solutions that are deemed to be invalid by a certain set of 
constraints, you en able the computer to reduce the time it takes to calucate all possible solution.
